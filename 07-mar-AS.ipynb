    "Mean: The mean is the average of a set of numbers. It is calculated by adding all the numbers in the set and dividing the sum by the total number of values.\n",
    "Suppose we have a set of numbers {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}. To find the mean, we add up all the numbers in the set and divide by the total number of values: (2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10) / 5 = 30 / 5 = 6. So the mean of this set is 6.\n",
    "\n",
    "Median: The median is the middle value in a set of numbers that have been arranged in order. It is the value that separates the higher half from the lower half of the data.Suppose we have a set of numbers {3, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 14}. To find the median, we first arrange the numbers in order from smallest to largest: {3, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 14}. The middle value is 9, so the median of this set is 9.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mode: The mode is the value that occurs most frequently in a set of data. It is the number that appears with the greatest frequency.Suppose we have a set of numbers {2, 4, 6, 4, 8, 10, 4}. To find the mode, we look for the value that occurs most frequently. In this set, the value 4 appears three times, which is more than any other value. So the mode of this set is 4."

The mean is sensitive to outliers, which means that if there are extreme values in the dataset, they can greatly affect the value of the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "The median is the middle value in a dataset when the data points are ordered from smallest to largest. If there is an even number of data points, the median is calculated as the average of the two middle values. The median is less sensitive to outliers than the mean, because it only depends on the values that are closer to the center of the dataset.\n",

    "The mode is the most common value in a dataset. It is the value that appears most frequently. The mode can be used to describe the typical value in a dataset, especially when the data is discrete and has a clear mode.\n",

    "All three measures of central tendency are useful for different types of data and situations. The mean is often used for continuous data that is normally distributed, while the median is used for skewed data or when there are outliers. The mode is useful for data with a clear peak or cluster of values.\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "A distribution is considered to be skewed if it is not symmetrical, meaning that the two sides of the distribution are not mirror images of each other. If the tail of the distribution is longer on one side than the other, the distribution is said to be skewed in the direction of the longer tail.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of skewness:\n",
    "\n",
    "Positive skewness: If the tail of the distribution is longer on the positive side, it is considered to be positively skewed. The mean of the data is usually greater than the median in a positively skewed distribution.\n",

    "Skewness is an important concept in statistics because it can affect the interpretation of the data and the validity of some statistical tests. For example, if the data is skewed, the mean may not be an appropriate measure of central tendency, and the use of non-parametric tests may be more appropriate than parametric tests."

    "Covariance is a measure of how two variables vary together. Specifically, it measures the degree to which two variables tend to move in the same direction. A positive covariance means that when one variable goes up, the other tends to go up as well, and vice versa for a negative covariance. However, covariance does not give information about the strength of the relationship or the degree to which the variables are related.\n",

Correlation measures not only the direction of the relationship but also its strength.\n",

    "In statistical analysis, covariance and correlation are used to analyze the relationship between two variables. Covariance is useful for understanding the direction of the relationship, but correlation is often preferred because it standardizes the measure and allows for comparisons between different datasets. Correlation is particularly useful in situations where we want to compare the relationship between two variables with different units of measurement or scales. For example, we can use correlation to measure the strength of the relationship between a person's height and weight, even though height and weight are measured in different units."

It measures how much two variables change together, i.e., if one variable increases, does the other variable also increase, decrease or remain constant.

An outlier is an observation that falls significantly outside the range of the other observations in the dataset. Outliers can be caused by measurement errors, data entry errors, or simply by chance.\n",

    "The presence of outliers can distort the measures of central tendency, such as the mean and the median, as they can pull the average value towards their direction. For example, in a dataset of salaries where most of the salaries are in the range of Rs.30,000 to Rs.80,000 per year, an outlier salary of Rs.500,000 per year will significantly increase the mean salary value, making it higher than the typical salary in the dataset. In contrast, the median salary will be less affected by the outlier, as it only considers the middle value in the dataset.\n",

    "As we can see, the outlier has a significant impact on the mean, which is much higher than the typical values in the dataset. The median, on the other hand, is less affected by the outlier and is closer to the center of the dataset. The range, variance, and standard deviation are also much larger than they would be if the outlier was not present, indicating that the dataset has a larger spread."
